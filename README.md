#.NET Design Patterns
This is the code repository for [.NET Design Patterns](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/net-design-patterns?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786466150), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Knowing about design patterns enables developers to improve their code base, promoting core reuse and making their architecture more robust.

This book focuses on the practical aspects of coding in .NET. You will learn about the most widely used and important design patterns (in action), which will ensure you do not sacrifice their functionality. We start with classic object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques, enhance implementations by mixing OOP and Functional Programming, and finally to the Reactive Programming model where Functional Programming and OOP are used in synergy to write better code.

Towards the end of this book, we’ll show you how to deal with Architecture/Design techniques, GOF patterns, some patterns from other Catalogs, Functional Programming, and Reactive Programming techniques.

After reading this book, you will be able to implement important design patterns for your programs, create major patterns viz. factory pattern, builder pattern, prototype patterns, adapter pattern, façade pattern, decorator pattern, etc. You will also be able to write fluid functional codes in DotNET that would leverage concurrency and parallelism!

##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
class Employee
{
  public String name {get;set;}
  public int age {get;set;}
  public double salary { get; set; }
}
```

The reader is supposed to have worked with at least a project with the .NET platform using C# as the primary programming language. A good understanding of basic object oriented programming will help you navigate the territory faster. From a software perspective, a laptop, desktop or a virtual machine with Visual Studio 2012 (or above) to test and play around with the source code
